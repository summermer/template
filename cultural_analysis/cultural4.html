			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
<p>Teaism has shaped all aspects of Chinese life. The simplicity of tea infuses Chinese hierarchy, as well as its spiritual enjoyment. Through two thousand years of development, Confucianism and Buddhism fill spirit into tea with their broad and profound thoughts, which make tea come alive. Tea culture is a combination of tea ceremonies and spirit; thus accomplishing spiritual expressions throughout the tea ceremony. In the process of making, smelling, and drinking tea, we strengthen our friendship; broaden our learning abilities through our interaction with others; and always like to hold an open floor discussion while we drinking tea together. Harmony, friendly and equality are really the key ideas for Chinese tea culture. It can still been prove by today, there is a common habit for every Chinese: when a guest come in to your house, the first thing you need to do is to make a cup of tea for guests it can shows your respect and welcome to them. Tea is symbolized respect and welcome in Chinese culture, as well as an interactive communication among human beings.
