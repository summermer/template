			<h1>Course retrospective</h1>
			<p> The title I choose is the name of one of my favorite book, written by Anthony, a young Chinese writer. I have habit of read books since I was a little. Then I start to interested in writing. First start with couple drawings since I was too young to know enough words to write. Then I start to write short fairytale come up by my own imagination. After I grow up to be a high school junior, I start my writing in more professional ways, I became a school newspaper editor. I’ve always believed that writing is the way to record life; it could be your own or people else life. And also it can create life, like if you are write a fiction story. So I’ve always believe my life is so tied with writing.</p>
        <p>Thus, unsurprisingly, basic on my own understanding of writing, the first time I saw Anthony’s article on a web, I became to like his writing style. The article is short. It is just about twenty lines, but over five thousand people share it. It seems don’t have a main topic at all. Anthony just talks about few interesting things in his life. He used words and vocabularies as simple as possible. The interesting thing is, he didn’t type any punctuation on-- not at all. It makes it more like a poem. If you gave this article to any of the mandarin teacher in Chinese junior high or high school, they will gave a zero point on it, and comment: “No punctuation. Lots of grammar mistakes. Even not a complex sentence. Are you sure you are writing a paper?” </p>
        <p>For some reason, I brought the book. When I read it first time, I find that not only his every article is really simple, but also the articles are similar. However, even you read tons of his articles, you are not tired of them. The words are simple, but are strong enough to expresses his thoughts and emotions in the article. Most of the readers, surprisingly, said they make same feeling with him. He was just wrote things about “I left my cell phone in the restaurant I went to yesterday. The waiter was so nice and he kept it for me. So I guess there is more good person than bad person in this world.” And the readers have nodded,” Yes, that’s true”, and reveled in the atmosphere that Anthony make.  </p>
        <p>So, I became one of the addicted readers as well. And I started write like Anthony wrote. You could see how my Facebook status had gradually changed style. I abandoned the way of set down a series of facts in a dairy, and started the “Anthony style”. Certainly, my friends like to see the articles I posted. Even we have different experience; the most common comment they gave is “I have a same feeling with you.” I enjoyed the writing like this. I got a place to drain my emotions, and someone will say: “I love your writing.” </p>
        <p>At this point, I start to understand the important thing for an author to remember is to make sure your reader can get your feeling and are able to understand what kind of motion you are trying to express. That is pretty much none business with how complicated words you are using and how fancy style you are using to tell your story. When I read Amy Tang’s article Mother Tongue, I found the exactly same feeling that I have with Amy Tang, or in other words she just expressed my thoughts in a perfectly way. Especially as an international student who study abroad and have to use the language other than our mother tongue. Maybe to use complicated grammar and words are not our way at all to show how skilled we are in English writing, but just to speak out our thoughts in most simple way. Then you can still be a good writer. </p>
        <p>Once I said in my literacy paper,” The teacher gave us a standard structure of English essay that was formed by topic sentences; point one, point two, point three and conclusion. He even labeled spaces on the structure that tell us where exactly we should put a famous sentence by a well-known person in.” Only when I was written a story, I will put some of my own thought in. So, when I choose the course WRA 110, I am pretty worried about the strict formal papers. It is not a pleasure that you have to squeeze few hours out to finish a piece of writing that you don’t like at all. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, I found out that the WRA class is not like the traditional writing class. It really gives student freedom in writing, especially came with a web site setting up by us, it has made this course more fun. After I hear about the requirement of the narratives paper, I thought, “wow maybe I could do something different, I can talk about my own story like a real writer”. So I talked about my own grow up story, how I moved from china to U.S. as an international student, and how things different between America and China. I wrote about things I never written in a school paper. To me, written the first paper is an enjoyment.</p>
        <p>The change of my mind in writing is more obvious in the culture artifact essay. The second paper is about culture artifacts, which is way more formal. When most of my classmates were choosing topics on material object like hockey, Chinese foods and Kungfu, I made a choice that I’m going to do more specific artifacts in this paper, which I choose “Chinese tea” as my subject finally. To be honest, in the process of writing, I’ve considered changing my topic few times. It is hard topic because “Chinese tea is an abstract idea. It could present a lot of thing and it’s hard to express the culture and philosophy in only couple words. It is a topic that so hard to get start with. The only reason I choose this topic is I have too much to say, more accurately, to explain to the people who don't know Chinese tea culture deeply how important is the tea means to our daily life. </p>
        <p>“Teaism has shaped all aspects of Chinese life. The simplicity of tea infuses Chinese hierarchy, as well as its spiritual enjoyment. Through two thousand years of development, Confucianism and Buddhism fill spirit into tea with their broad and profound thoughts, which make tea come alive. Tea culture is a combination of tea ceremonies and spirit; thus accomplishing spiritual expressions throughout the tea ceremony.” This is the main idea of my culture artifact paper. It is a challenge to introduce an artifact with a culture background. So after I finished my paper I still feel that there is something is missing, if I can use another way to express my thoughts then expand some of my ideas from the paper then the paper can be called complete. So after the remix project coming out, I was so excited to get the chance to do my remix project.</p>
        <p>After I start to work on my remix project, I re picked the idea for what I’m going to express in the project. I talked a lot about tea culture connected with Chinese history in my original paper. But in the remix I choose to move my focus on to bring more introductions about what is a tea ceremony looks like and how it connected to the tea culture. For the arrangement I firstly start with introduction about the tea as a whole culture artifact then I connected tea ceremony and the tea culture but couple sentences, just for people to understand how the artifacts I’m talking about involve with the whole culture. At the end of my video I put in an short video of a real tea ceremony, which I believe it will helps deliver my main idea to the audience directly. Through this project I’ve got better understanding about RAIDS. Especially while I need to make my own video. It is like to use a way other than words to describe your thinking and feeling. It has also benefit me of my understanding of writing. </p>
        <p>I am pretty satisfied with what I’ve written and tell in my three papers. At least I have work really hard for them. Also I’ve enjoyed in couple reading we’ve done in this class. It even makes school-written paper interesting. And I’m really enjoying the whole process we’ve gone through in this class. It has helped me to improve my writing skills and some how changed my writing style to more professional way as a really college student.</p>
