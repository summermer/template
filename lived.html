		<p>When I was a child, I always enjoy watching TV with my parents, so I can ask them so many questions comes from my curiosity. Question about how can they show in the TV and how their voice is able to passed to us, pretty much how everything function about the TV I was interested in and confused. In my tiny mind back in that time, TV is like the most magic thing in the world that I kept a strong interest in.</p>
        <p>The enthusiasm about TV went down a little while my parents get us the first computer in our house. It seems smaller but way smarter than a normal TV to me. When I got the first touch with computer then start to learn the using way, I said to myself  “wow, this thing is so amazing and full of mystery!” TV and computer got some similar parts, but computer got one advance that TV is not able to have back in that time, that is Internet. By the time the Internet first come out, people are so excited and impressed about how easy they can communicate with people are actually living in half way across the world, and how fast all the news, gossips, funny things spread out. During that time I was one of them for sure.</p>
        <p>Now when I think back, I’ve always considered it is because of the new media culture is so active in my hometown, which became the main reason for me to make the decision on my major, media information and communication. The city where I grow up named Changsha, which full fill with the media culture. </p>
        <p>But after the time I continuing grow up, I start to realize that media actually turns out to have huge power in it. TV, newspaper, Internet are actually all tied up together with each other. The media we all talk about all the time is not only the message sending out process, but also have the power to leads the public thinking and concerns. I’m became fascinating with how much media can creates. </p>
        <p>The final moment for me to make the decision on my major was covered with one little story I went through in high school. Since I’ve always held such passion with media, I became an editor in our high school TV station. After I started work in the TV station, many of my childhood confuse has been solved. I learned how to take record for a short interview, how to use computer programs to cut off the parts of a video that we don’t need, and how to design a poster to let every one in campus get interest in a new activity hold by school. I still remember how was the feeling of create my own short interview video by iMovie and how excited I was when I saw the poster I made by Photoshop and InDesign had been posted everywhere in our campus. I can still tell my passion of learning more skills to deal with the media path especially after I got those tiny successes. After what I’ve been done during high school time, I became not only a follower of media but also one of the creators of media. So when the time I got in MSU, I choose my major to be media information and communication without even one moment hesitates. </p>
        <p>Media information and communication is both challenging major for students. They all require really good ability to write and to express thoughts and feelings. Also you better be pretty creative. Otherwise TV shows and movies might get boring after generations, and no one wants that to be true. So when these requires come to me, which is a second language speaker in this field, I start to face many difficulties because the language skills. After couple time failures of describe my ideas for some class project, I almost want to give this up. One thought have been in my mind for days, it keep saying maybe you should just go ahead change a major and take some business course just like other International student does, you always think its unfair that you always come up with good idea but you don’t have the ability to build it up yet, so you should just give it up. I was desperate when the first time I fail to pass one of the courses from my major. I spend my worst Christmas time that year because of the disappointed.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, I didn’t just throw my dreams away after that long period of disappointment. Everything starts to get better after I took one advertising class. As an important part leads my interest in Media information, advertising is definitely playing a significant role. Advertising in performance forms is a cooperation service for products of publicity, and a kind of commercial marketing means. Even more, the connotation of advertising is a reflection of culture. A Successful advertisement does not often expose its true message; instead, the company cleverly hides its business motivation and commercial properties to attract and inform consumers about their products. To achieve this goal, advertising needs to apply literature and art. In my advertising class, the professor asked us to group up then finish a topic project together, basically just about design a fine attractive advertising for a company. The art design part, which makes me feel I still got this again.  While I working with my group, I speak out my concerns about my drawbacks with the language-organized part so I recommend myself to in charge with the art design part. Since I’ve already so familiar with all the software we need to use for the advertising, I did a great job in my part so finally our group got a really good feedback from our professor and other students in class. This short experience just brings back my confidence about working as a media creator again.</p>
        <p>I choose my major to be media and information based on my interests. I like to watch a new ideas come out from all the traditional media method and also impressed by new media’s power of effect. After all the curious thinking and guessing, struggling and hesitating, I’ve decided to actually put my future career on this way, so I can finally create all the new idea and spread them out.</p>
