			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>We taste the bitterness in the progress throughout our lives; we receive birth, we get old, we encounter sickness, and we meet death inevitably. In a short word, every form of material and spirit in the process of human existence factors can be identified as bringing "bitter". In fact, every kind of tea has some taste of bitterness, but we can taste sweetness after the bitter, which indicates that Zen is to see through the live and death, and to reach the “Da Che Da Wu”, which means greatly discerning and apprehending. From the characteristics of sweet after bitter and sweet in the bitter, the Buddhism can produce many ideological connections, and help to practice the dharma about tea, and life, which is the "bitter truths.” The tea ceremony exquisites quiet, and the Buddhism also consider quiet as the way to reach the peaceful status in mind. As the Japanese tea ceremony master Sen no Rikyu said: "you must know that the essence of tea is boiling water." It reveals that the essence of tea ceremony in Buddhism is to understand the profound philosophies from our ordinary daily life. People often get upset because they "cannot release" for they are too dedicated on holding materialism tightly to let it go, so Buddhist practice specially emphasis on “release". Under the influence of Buddhist, tea has been given to another crucial function, which is for people to relax themselves. Take a rest, and enjoy some tea, relax ourselves frayed nerves and imprisoned behaviors. When you release things burdening you, you feel comfortable. Therefore, you refill the energy to keep moving on.</p>
