			<p>Week 1</p>
            <p>No class! Yeah!</p>
            
            <p>Week 2</p>
            <p>It is aways exciting to start a new semester. In our first class we went through course syllabus and talk about the first paper which is our lived experience paper. First of all I'm a little confused about what narrative is.</p>
            
            <p>Week 3</p>
            <p>After the lived experience paper been introduced more I got a clue on what should I write finally. My major is social media which have a lot of technologies involve. So I decide to write about the time when Internet came up and computer start to show in everyones daily life. I think that is the main event that leads me to my current major.</p>
            
            <p>Week 4</p>
            <p>After 2 weeks work I turned in my lived experience paper. While I write the paper I also get more chance to think about my major and my former decisions. It was a good opportunity to review a lot of things. And I am actually enjoying the experience of writing now.</p>
            
            <p>Week 5</p>
            <p>When I first hear the idea of our cultural analysis paper I know what I will do for this paper. I think I'm going to write about tea as my culture artifact. Since I always consider tea is a important element to Chinese people and got a lot of meaning within it.</p>
            
            <p>Week 6</p>
            <p>We watched the movie social network in class. I'll definetily consider this is the most fun class in this semester so far. I love watching movie so I can get different ideas of movie and learn about it. Also I was always hoping to get a job in movie or Internet industry so the story is the part I most intrest in.</p>
            
            <p>Week 7</p>
            <p>This week we peer reviewed our draft of the cultural artifact essay. I think I'm on the right track to start</p>
            
            <p>Week 8</p>
            <p>Yeah the cultural artifact is done! But! Oh another assinment has been introduced to us. The formal research paper might be a huge challenge for me since it requires a lot of reading. Worried face here =( </p>
            
            <p>Week 9</p>
            <p>The draft of formal research paper is due on this week. But I think my draft are looking good so far. I collect ideas and develop them by myselfs around my main ideas and also had a interview with one of my professor. The interview is actually helping a lot with my confuse.</p>
            
            <p>Week 10</p>
            <p>After I finished my formal research paper I feel such a release. And to writing the paper has also helped me gain more knowledge of my major. </p>
            
            <p>Week 11</p>
            <p>I turned in my work this week. I feel this research paper has helped me a lot with my reading and understanding. Because I did go through a lot of materials of my major. Also I'm exciting about next assignment ---- the multimedia remix project.</p>
            
            <p>Week 12</p>
            <p>I'm working on my remix project. And the final paper has been introduced. It is getting close to the end feeling that everyone start to become busier. Also it's werid that this years snow still not coming!</p>
            
            <p>Week 13</p>
