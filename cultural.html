			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>What is tea? By definition, tea is “the dried and prepared leaves of a shrub, Camellia sinensis, from which a somewhat bitter, aromatic beverage is prepared by infusion in hot water” (dictionary.com). Why is tea so popular if it is only some leaves of a shrub? As the Japanese aesthete Kakuzo Okakura states, “A cup of tea is a complex brew of art and industry, tradition and revolution, East and West” (3). In other words, Okakura believes that there are various layers beyond the tea, which make tea as a culture artifact. In the homeland of tea, Chinese people have always kept the tradition and the culture of drinking tea. Through centuries, tea is never only considered as a drink but one of the best cultures that have been passing along from ancient China. To be more thorough, tea in China combines the diverse thoughts and philosophies together that also relate to the hierarchy and spirit; this 'fact' has made tea become an irreplaceable part and a representation of the true essence of Chinese traditional culture. </p>
