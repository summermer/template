			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The prices of tea help to determine class status in China. The price of tea is a significant factor that can indicate people’s classes, especially social status. There are various types of tea, and the price difference is huge. For instance, you can purchase a pack of tea for ten Yuan in the daily market; you can also bid 200,000 Yuan for just 20 grams in some tea party. Who determines the price of tea? Does this kind of tea really worth that much? In The Incidental Economist, Austin Frakt maintains that, “At the moment, asking what something has to do with the price of tea in China is an unfair question. Nobody can know the answer empirically. Of course, theoretically, the answer is, ‘Nothing.’ But theorists can be wrong” (Frakt). Frakt’s report shows us that the price of tea is really depend on people, it is the people raised up the price. So the price really cannot simply measure the precious of tea but it might be a easy way to determine the quality of the tea. Why people raised up the price of tea and willing to buy, if the price cannot measure the good or bad? The answer is they pay attention to the rarity of the tea. Furthermore, usually people purchase expensive tea is not only for own enjoyment, but also as a gift. The price of tea illustrates the respect to receiver, and also represents buyer’s financial status, which means showing their class status. Consequently, various price of tea symbolized different classes of people. More importantly, when people are care about the price, they have lost the pleasure of drinking tea.</p>
