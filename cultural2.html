			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In Chinese history, the class system is solid and exists everywhere; under this system each class has unequal rights, and the development of tea perfectly illustrates this concept. According to the very first monograph on tea in the world, The Classic of Tea by Yu Lu, there were three main stages of development of tea and tea culture. The first stage was the original use period for tea, which was before Qin dynasty. Tea was for medical use, drinking, and sacrifices, and it was considered as a kind of tribute, only serving for most privileged people. The second stage was the expansion of tea from Han dynasty to Sui dynasty. In Han dynasty, tea had become daily recreation and spread out in noble class. Until Jin Dynasty, tea started to appear in markets and immediately became popular in low-middle class. The third stage started at Tang dynasty. Tea reached its climax because all people were able to enjoy tea and built tea culture with a strong atmosphere. Lu indicated that there were more than thousands of years during its discovery and popularity in the community, revealing an idea that the higher class always has the priority to enjoy good things first and then slowly turned to the public. Chinese class system specifies the amount of rights and power for various classes, and makes clear boundaries between people. However, only when tea is available and popular in all class, it can become a cultural phenomenon. </p>
